StrangeAttractor.Util.Functional
================================

C# library for error handling in functional style (inspired by Scala and Haskell) - Option (Maybe), Try, Either, Validation

# ** Motivation **
The aim of this library is to provide classes which simplify error handling in .NET applications and preserve referential transparency in order to make it possible for your code to seamlessly use functional C# features.

# ** Inspiration **
This implementation was inspired by the Scala and Haskell languages and by an article about Maybe monad http://lanshiva.blogspot.co.at/2011/02/applied-functional-programming-in-c.html
